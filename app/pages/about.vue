    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Gary Woodfine, I'm an independent software developer, architect, consultant, blogger, Bitcoin & Nostr Enthusiast.
      I've provided software development expertise and helped augment software development skills and teams for a number of
      startups, product companies, corporate IT shops, and consulting firms.</p>

    <p>I started out in the software world back in 1995, building websites with Hot Metal Pro and ASP and moved on to
      building web apps with .NET when it released. Since then, I've shipped systems in just about every industry.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I've strived to improve how I and my teams deliver value to the clients, customers, and end-users.
      That has led me down the path of exploring Agile, Domain-Driven Design, REST, messaging, distributed systems,
      and anything else I thought could help.</p>
