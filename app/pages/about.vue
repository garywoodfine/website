    <p>Hi, I'm Gary Woodfine, I'm an independent software developer, architect, consultant, blogger, Bitcoin & Nostr Enthusiast.
      I've provided software development expertise and helped augment software development skills and teams for a number of
      startups, product companies, corporate IT shops, and consulting firms.</p>

    <p>I started out in the software world back in 1995, building websites with HoTMetaL Pro & ASP and moved on to
      building web apps with .NET when it released in Beta in 2001, since then, I've shipped systems in just about every industry.</p>
    <p>Along the path, I have also shipped various platforms & products in Java, PHP, Javascript, Go, Rust, Python & just about
    any lanaguage or software development framework that has had its moment in the sun, but somehow I have always made way
    back to .Net.</p>


    <p>Over the years, I've strived to improve how I and my teams deliver value to the clients, customers, and end-users.
      That has led me down the path of exploring Agile, Domain-Driven Design, REST, messaging, distributed systems,
      and anything else I thought could help.</p>
